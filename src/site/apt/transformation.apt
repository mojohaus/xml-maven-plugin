           Transforming XML files
           ----------------------

Transforming XML files

  To transform XML files by applying XSLT stylesheets, use the "xml:transform"
  goal is used. It is configured through a section like the following in your
  POM:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>xml-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>transform</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
          <transformationSets>
            <transformationSet>
              <dir>xml</dir>
              <stylesheet>it4.xsl</stylesheet>
            </transformationSet>
          </transformationSets>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The example would transform all files in the directory "xml" by applying
  the stylesheet "it4.xml". The output would be written to the directory
  "${project.build.directory}/generated-resources/xml/xslt" (usually
  "target/generated-resources/xml/xslt").

Goal properties

  The "xml:transform" goal offers the following configurable properties:

*--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Property Name      | Description                                                     |
*--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| basedir            | The base directory, which is used for interpreting relative     |
|                    | paths. Defaults to the project directory, in which the POM      |
|                    | resides.                                                        |
*--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| catalogs           | A set of catalog files, which configure the entity resolver.    |
|                    | For example, it allows to map public ID's or external URL's to  |
|                    | local files. Multiple catalog files are supported. In other     |
|                    | words, to configure a single catalog file, you would need a     |
|                    | section like this:                                              |
|                    |                                                                 |
|                    | \<catalogs\>                                                    |
|                    |   \<catalog\>mycatalog.xml\</catalog\>                          |
|                    | \</catalogs\>                                                   |
|                    |                                                                 |
|                    | The interpretation of catalog files is done by the Apache XML   |
|                    | resolver. See                                                   |
|                    | {{{http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/resolver-article.html}this}} |
|                    | article for details on catalog files and their formats.         |
*--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| transformationSets | A transformation set configures a set of XML files, which are   |
|                    | transformed by applying a common XSLT stylesheet. If you want   |
|                    | apply multiple stylesheets, use multiple transformation sets.   |
|                    | See the above example, which specifies a single transformation  |
|                    | The various child elements of a \<transformationSet\> section   |
|                    | listed in the following section.                                |
*--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

Transformation Set Configuration

  A transformation set is configured through several child elements:

*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Element Name        | Description                                                     |
*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| attributes          | Specifies attributes, which are being set on the transformer    |
|                     | factory by invoking the setAttribute(String, Object) method.    |
*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| addedToClasspath    | Specifies, whether the output directory is being added to the   |
|                     | to the classpath. Defaults to true.                             |
*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| dir                 | Sets the name of a directory, which is scanned for the files,   |

|                     | the directory given by "dir". This element may be repeated      |
|                     | as much as needed.                                              |
*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| features            | Specifies features, which are being set on the transformer      |

| forceCreation       | If 'true', no up-to-date check is performed and                 |
|                     | the transformation is always performed.                         |
|                     | Defaults to "${xml.forceCreation}" or 'false'.                  |
*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| includes            | Specifies a pattern of files, which are being included. By      |
|                     | default, all files are included. The pattern is relative to     |
|                     | the directory given by "dir". This element may be repeated      |
|                     | as much as needed.                                              |
*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| otherDepends        | A list of of extra input files or URLs to consider during       |    
|                     | the up-to-date check, useful for when resolving remote files.   |
|                     | By default it always considers:                                 |
|                     |   1. input files,                                               |
|                     |   2. XSLT file,                                                 |
|                     |   3. catalog files, and                                         |
|                     |   4. the pom.xml file of the project executing this plugin.     | 
*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| outputDir           | Specifies the name of the output directory, where the generated |
|                     | files are being placed. Defaults to                             |

|                     | Usually, this is equivalent to                                  |
|                     | "target/generated-resources/xml/xslt".                          |
*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| skipDefaultExcludes | Specifies whether the maven's default exludes should NOT        |
|                     | be added to the excludes list.                                  |
*---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| stylesheet          | Specifies the stylesheet, which is being used for transforming  |
|                     | the fileset. A stylesheet must be specified, there is no        |
|                     | default.                                                        |
